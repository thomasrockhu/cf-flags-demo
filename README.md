## What is this?

CF-Flags-Demo is a python application whose purpose is to demonstrate the usage of [carryforward flags](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/carryforward-flags) in a basic python application.

Carryforward Flags are primarily designed for that projects that do no upload total coverage for every commit (e.g., monorepos with multiple applications/languages, iterative/partial/delta testing setups, etc). If this describes your use case, it is recommended to review [the docs](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/carryforward-flags) before implementing carryforward flags in your own project.
